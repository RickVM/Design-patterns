**Design patterns**

**Goal**

This document is part of a series of documents I will create as part of my studies of Design patterns.    
The aim is to improve my Software programming and architecture skills.  
Although some might argue that using design patterns is merely a lack of abstraction ability I feel that whilst building this skill design patterns will give me a better and more solid foundation rather than   reinventing everything myself. Furthermore I believe that learning the most popular design patterns will help me build this abstraction ability more quickly as I expand my knowledge of software design.  

**Scope**
In these documents I will touch the topic of what I learned with the corresponding design pattern and I will further put it to practice by giving relevant examples.  
Furthermore at the end of my Semester, February 2018, I might revisit some of these documents to shed light on patterns that I was able to use during my projects.  

**Planning**
This activity is more of an extra course I am following in my free time, therefore I have not set a clear goal for how many design patterns I want to finish as I am doing this extra for 'fun'.  

**Resources**
I will use the book Head First Design patterns by O'Reilly to study these patterns.  
The book explains the patterns in Java, I will implement them in either Java or .Net depending on what I feel like.
